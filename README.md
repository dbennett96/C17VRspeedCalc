# C-17 Globemaster III Takeoff Speed Calculator

## Description
This C++ application calculates the takeoff speed, or Rotation Speed \(V<sub>R</sub>) for a C-17 Globemaster III aircraft. 
The calculator considers various parameters such as fuel load, passenger and cargo weight, field elevation, and environmental conditions. 
It adjusts the V<sub>R</sub> factor for added safety margin at high field elevation or heavy loads.

## Features
- **Input Ops Parameters**: Users input the fuel load, passenger weight, cargo weight, and field elevation for calculations.
- **Environmental Adjustments**: The calculator adjusts the required takeoff speed based on user inputs of local temperature, barometric pressure, and humidity.
- **Dynamic Air Density Calculation**: Computes air density based on provided environmental inputs.
- **Variable V<sub>R</sub> Factor**: Increases the calculated V<sub>R</sub> to incorporate a safety margin for heavy loads or high field elevations.
